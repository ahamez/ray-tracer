# Ray Tracer Challenge

This is an implementation in Rust of the book [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://www.raytracerchallenge.com) . Go get it, it's one of the best book I read!

My main objective is to be fluent in Rust ðŸ—£ðŸ¦€. So, if some seasoned rustacean comes across this, don't hesitate to pinpoint the problems ðŸ˜‰!

## Differences from the book
* Parallelization with [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) (I can't believe how easy it was!)
* Matrices inversion are cached (which provides a significant speedup!)
